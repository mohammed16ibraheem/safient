# Safient – Recover What Others Lose

Safient wraps Algorand transfers in an AI-guarded protection window so hacked or phished funds snap back to the rightful owner. A flat **0.1 ALGO Safient fee** protects every transfer, and after the window ends the money reaches the intended recipient automatically.

## Why Safient
- **Undo a breach** – If a wallet is compromised, the sender reclaims the transfer instantly.
- **Zero babysitting** – When the protection window closes, Safient releases the funds to the recipient without human intervention.
- **Signal for partners** – Exchanges, wallets, and dApps embed Safient’s APIs to give their users the same safety net.
- **Always learning** – AI threat analysis, address intelligence, and real-time scoring keep improving with every incident.

## Why We Built Safient
I lost assets myself—one phishing link in a trusted wallet drained everything. Rather than accept it, I built Safient so no one else has to watch their balance disappear with zero recourse. Even a 1% chance to recover funds is worth giving people hope; Safient is that second chance.

## What Problem Do We Solve?
Victims rarely recover funds once a blockchain transaction is confirmed. Safient introduces a brief, AI-supervised holding phase so suspicious activity can be reversed. No other consumer-facing protection on Algorand offers automatic recovery with live monitoring.

## AI Security Scan Workflow
During the protection window we run the following staged checks (currently simulated dummy,ready for VPS deployment once the tuned models are pushed): vercel as some limits 

1. Initializing AI Security Scan
2. Connecting to Blockchain Nodes
3. Querying Safient AI Database
4. Analyzing Transaction History
5. Cross-referencing Security Networks
6. Verifying Address Integrity
7. Deep Learning Analysis
8. Calculating Risk Assessment
