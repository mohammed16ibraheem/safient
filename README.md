# Safient – Recover What Others Lose

Safient wraps Algorand transfers in an AI-guarded protection window so hacked or phished funds snap back to the rightful owner. A flat **0.1 ALGO Safient fee** protects every transfer, and after the window ends the money reaches the intended recipient automatically.

## Why Safient
- **Undo a breach** – If a wallet is compromised, the sender reclaims the transfer instantly.
- **Zero babysitting** – When the protection window closes, Safient releases the funds to the recipient without human intervention.
- **Signal for partners** – Exchanges, wallets, and dApps embed Safient’s APIs to give their users the same safety net.
- **Always learning** – AI threat analysis, address intelligence, and real-time scoring keep improving with every incident.

## Why We Built Safient
I lost everything to a single phishing link. Watching a trusted wallet get emptied with zero recourse changed me — I refused to accept that as the final answer. Safient exists so others don’t have to face that helplessness. Whether funds are stolen by a scam, sent to the wrong address by accident, or taken through coercion, even a small chance to recover assets matters. Safient gives people that chance — a safety net, a second shot, and hope when it matters most.

## What Problem Do We Solve?
Victims rarely recover funds once a blockchain transaction is confirmed. Safient introduces a brief, AI-supervised holding phase so suspicious activity can be reversed. No other consumer-facing protection on Algorand offers automatic recovery with live monitoring.

## AI Security Scan Workflow
During the protection window, Safient runs a staged AI-driven security scan. The system is already functional, but due to hosting limits on Vercel, the full deep analysis model is currently replaced with a partial simulation. The core algorithm is completed and operational. Once the VPS model nodes are funded and deployed, the full workflow will run live in real time.

1. Initializing AI Security Scan
2. Connecting to Blockchain Nodes
3. Querying Safient AI Database
4. Analyzing Transaction History
5. Cross-referencing Security Networks
6. Verifying Address Integrity
7. Deep Learning Analysis
8. Calculating Risk Assessment

I have already developed the main algorithm that powers this system using AI, especially for transaction behavior detection and anomaly scoring. At the moment, only 60% of the full model is deployed due to resource limits. The logic is complete and production-ready, and the next step is to host the model on a dedicated VPS server so the full analysis can process live data at real scale.
